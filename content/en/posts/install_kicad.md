3. **Install KiCad:**
   - Open the downloaded disk image and drag the KiCad application to your Applications folder.

#### Linux:

1. **Package Manager (Debian/Ubuntu):**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Run the following commands to add the KiCad PPA and install KiCad:
     ```bash
     sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-5.99
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install kicad
     ```

2. **Package Manager (Fedora):**
